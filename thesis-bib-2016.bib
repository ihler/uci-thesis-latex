Recall rules for title: words that are always to be capitalized are
   placed in {Curly Braces} while other words should be capitalized
   as they would be printed for those journals that like capitalized
   titles; for other journals, like AGU, these words will be set in
   lower case.

These rules do not apply to BOOKTITLE, which is printed as is.

The first letter of a note text will also be set in lower case, unless
  placed in curly braces.

Can use {Curly Braces} over entire title or note for exact capitalization
   as shown below

@misc{uci-thesis-latex:2016,
	title = {{LaTeX template for thesis and dissertation documents at UC Irvine}},
	author = {Sutterley, Tyler and Otten, Lars and Harmon, Trevor and Ge, Xianping},
	year = 2016,
	url = {https://github.com/tsutterley/uci-thesis-latex/}
}
 
@misc{natbib:2010,
	title = {{natbib - Flexible bibliography support}},
