Some items to have on hand:  
 -  A PDF copy of your dissertation/thesis. This must be a single file. If your manuscript is in Word or RTF format, we can convert it into a PDF.
 -  Abstract
 -  Optional Supplementary files (images, data, etc.) that are an integral part of the dissertation/thesis, but not part of the full text.
 -  Advisor and other Committee Members' Names
 -  Subject Categories - 1 - 3 that best describe your dissertation/thesis' [subject area](http://corpweb.proquest.com/assets/etd/umi_subjectcategoriesguide.pdf).


ProQuest charges different publishing fees depending on the publishing options that you select.  
 -  The current fee for the Traditional Publishing option is $65 for doctoral dissertations and $55 for Master’s theses.  
 -  The fee for the Open Access Publishing option is $160 for doctoral dissertations and $55 for Master’s theses.  
 -  UCI will the cover the cost of the Traditional Publishing fee ($65 for doctoral dissertations, $55 for Master’s theses) regardless of whether you select the Traditional or Open Access option.  
 -  Students who choose the Open Access option will be responsible for paying the difference between the Traditional Publishing Fee and the Open Access Fee. ($95 for both doctoral dissertations and Master’s theses)  

#### Why use Git for manuscripts?
 -  Single files: using git simplifies things as there's only a single version of a manuscript.
 -  Merging: if two people work on the same file at the same time, they can be merged without much issue.
 -  Simplified "diff" documents: can also use latexdiff-vc (latexdiff with version control) to make pdf files similar to Word documents with "Track Changes". More information [here](../../wiki/LaTeX-Tools).
 -  Easier collaboration: No need to email files back and forth.
